## Features

- Cross platform, works on Windows / Mac / Linux
- GUI and command line interfaces
- Scan your local switch backup library (NSP/NSZ/XCI)
- Read titleId/version by decrypting NSP/XCI/NSZ (requires prod.keys)
- If no prod.keys present, fallback to read titleId/version by parsing file name (example: `Super Mario Odyssey [0100000000010000][v0].nsp`).
- Lists missing update files (for games and DLC)
- Lists missing DLCs
- Automatically organize games per folder
- Rename files based on metadata read from NSP
- Delete old update files (in case you have multiple update files for the same game, only the latest will remain)
- Delete empty folders
- Zero dependencies, all crypto operations implemented in Go

## Keys (optional)

Having a prod.keys file will allow you to ensure the files you have a correctly classified.
The app will look for the "prod.keys" file in the app folder or under ${HOME}/.switch/
You can also specify a custom location in the settings.json (see below)

Note: Only the header_key, and the key_area_key_application_XX keys are required.

## Settings

During the App first launch a "settings.json" file will be created, that allows for granular control over the Apps execution.

You can customize the folder/file re-naming, as well as turn on/off features, and set specific title ids of DLC or updates to ignore.

```

## Naming template

The following template elements are supported:

- {TITLE_NAME} - game name
- {TITLE_ID} - title id
- {VERSION} - version id (only applicable to files)
- {VERSION_TXT} - version number (like 1.0.0) (only applicable to files)
- {REGION} - region
- {TYPE} - impacts DLCs/updates, will appear as ["UPD","DLC"]
- {DLC_NAME} - DLC name (only applicable to DLCs)

### macOS or Linux

- Extract the zip file
- Double click the App file
- If you want to use command line mode, update the settings.json with `'GUI':false`
  - Open your Terminal
  - `cd` to the folder containing `switch-library-manager`
  - `chmod +x switch-library-manager` to make it executable
  - Run `./switch-library-manager'
